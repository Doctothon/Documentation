#### The Idea of the Git Flow

The Git flow, is a concept, an idea of how to manage collaboration between engineers.

We at doctothon, believe in proved science, so instead of discussing the git flow, let us takle through using it, and we discuss when ideas and questions pop up. :hammer:

But well, if you feel like, have a look at [the references section at bottom of this page](/en/getincloudteam/6.install-git-flow/#references), you'll find reading and watching material.

The Git flow, is a concept, and several sofftwares implemented that concept. For example, here below are two different softwares, which implement that concept (do not install any of them yet!) :
* https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-flow-avh#default
* https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-flow#default

I want to inisist those above are 2 different softwares, for one very important, fundamental, reason : they are not built from the same source code, not even two different versions of the same versioned source code.


At least 90% if npt 100% of world uses ONE SPECIFIC software, which implements the Git flow : the [`Git Flow AVH Edition`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

We at the Doctothon Cloud, do just the same as the rest of the world, we use the [`Git Flow AVH Edition`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

## Install the `Git Flow AVH Edition`

### Windows

You have [installed git for windows](/fr/gitworkflows/install-git/)

```bash
# -+- #
# -

```


* a software
* git is a software, The `Git flow AVH Edition` is A DIFFERENT software : once installed, it extends git with new commands. We use that set of git flow comands at doctothon, to standardize our Git Workflow
